When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would create a remote repository when I want to collaborate with others or get feedback from someone.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because collaboration. If you're both making changes and commits, auto push/pull could create conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a copy of someone else's repository that you do not have permission to modify, it maintains a link to the original repository.
  A clone is a copy of a repository either locally or on GitHub without links back to the originator.
  A branch is a set of new commits off master that usually involve new features that you need to test.
  I would use a fork when I want to modify or try out someone else's code. I'd use a clone when I wanted to modify my own or someone else's code but I didn't plan on sharing it. I would use branch when I need to test a new feature without modifying master.
